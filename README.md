Linguistic stimuli: 18 passage audios (city descriptions excerpted from travel guides; 9 in English, 9 in Hebrew) recorded by three female, highly proficient bilinguals.

Visual stimuli: 3 isoluminant screen-saver video clips.

While all trials are around 30s long, to make it consistent, we could use 28s as a standard duration for analysis (because the shortest trial is ~28.5s).
