% Functions to be used in the following order:

1.- replaceEyeLinkStrings() <br />

This function consistently replaces certain trigger-related strings generated from the EyeLink system, so as to facilitate the synchronization of eye movement and EEG/ECG data in the following "mergeHeartEyeEEG.m" function (which uses the "EYE-EEG" plugin that requires the same prefix before the trigger number when parsing the eye movement data). <br />

Input files are the ".asc" files (under the "Eye movement" folder) that are converted from ".edf" files using the "Visual EDF2ASC" app on Windows. <br />

Output files are "_new.asc" files (also under the "Eye movement" folder).

2.- mergeHeartEyeEEG() <br />

This function (1) combines eye movement and EEG/ECG data using the "EYE-EEG" plugin in EEGLAB, (2) downsamples the EEG data to 250 Hz, and (3) merges EEG data from the linguistic and nonlinguistic recordings. <br />

Input files are (1) eye movement files: "_new.asc" files (each participant has 2 under the "Eye movement" folder: one for linguistic, one for nonlinguistic) generated by the "replaceEyeLinkStrings.m" function above; (2) EEG/ECG files: ".eeg", ".vhdr", ".vmrk" files created by BrainVision (each participant has 6 under the "Eye movement" folder: 3 for linguistic, 3 for nonlinguistic). <br />

Output files are "0XX.set" and "0XX.fdt" files (in EEGLAB format; under the participant number folder), where 0XX indicates participant number (same below).

3.- preprocHeartEyeEEG() <br />

This function preprocesses the EEG data using EEGLAB, including resampling, filtering, and cleaning it. Note that it doesn't process the ECG and eye movement data. <br />

Input files are the "0XX.set" files (under the participant number folder) obtained from the "mergeHeartEyeEEG.m" function above. <br />

Output files are (1) "EEG_0XX.set" and "EEG_0XX.fdt" files (in EEGLAB format; contain the preprocessed EEG data); and (2) "HR_EYE_0XX.set" and "HR_EYE_0XX.fdt" files (contain the  unprocessed ECG and eye movement data). Both are under the participant number folder.

4.- procEKG() <br />

This function preprocesses the ECG data using the "EEG-Beats" plugin in EEGLAB and output excel files that contain various extracted heart rate measures. <br />

Input files are the 'HR_EYE_0XX.set' files obtained from the "preprocHeartEyeEEG.m" function above. <br />

Output files are 4 excel files ("table_HRxxxxx.xlsx" included in the repository). Each of them represents one experimental manipulation ('English', 'Hebrew', 'Easy', 'Hard') and contains multiple heart rate measures extracted using the EEG-Beats plugin for all participants.

5.- IC_manual_rejection()  <br />

This function manually rejects components that account for non-brain activity. 

Output from this script is the *_ICremov.set

**Notes**

% Participants 040, 055, and 086 (subjects [27, 41, 72]) encountered errors, prompting us to skip these cases. Should the issues be resolved, rerun the pipeline for these participants. There is also an unidentified error for participant 012 (subject [6]) when running procHR().

% Initially, we aimed to process the synchronized EEG-HR-EYE data in a single file. However, due to complications with the clean_artifacts function's operation on specific channels, we opted to split the data back into EEG and HR-EYE components for simplicity and to ensure smooth processing.

**Stimuli**

Linguistic stimuli: 18 passage audios (city descriptions excerpted from travel guides; 9 in English, 9 in Hebrew) recorded by three female, highly proficient bilinguals.

Nonlinguistic stimuli: 18 musical tone audios (a combination of different instrument sounds; 9 Easy and 9 Hard, vary by a number of instruments) synthesized using Audition.

Visual stimuli: 3 isoluminant screen-saver video clips.

**Data**

EEG/ECG (1000 Hz) and eye movement (500 Hz) were simultaneously recorded via a Trigger Box. 

**Markers**

In the linguistic condition, the markers are:

  *Onset English (S1, S5, S9) (Onsets marks the beginning of a passage)
  There are a total of 10 trials. The initial trial serves as a practice round and should be excluded from the analysis.
  
  *Onset Hebrew (S3, S7, S11)
  There are a total of 10 trials. The initial trial serves as a practice round and should be excluded from the analysis.
  
  *Offset (S2, S4, S6, S8, S10, S12): Offsets mark the end of a passage, showing when a segment of language or speech concludes.
  
  *Question Onset (S13 or S14) 
  
  *Response (S16 or S32)
  
  *S111 and S112 are the experiment beggining and end, respectively.

In the NONlinguistic condition, the markers are:

  Onset Easy (S1) (Onsets marks the beginning of a passage).
  There are a total of 10 trials. The initial trial serves as a practice round and should be excluded from the analysis.
  
  Onset Hard (S3)
  There are a total of 10 trials. The initial trial serves as a practice round and should be excluded from the analysis.
  
  Offset (S2, S4): Offsets mark the end of a passage.
  
  Question Onset (S13 or S14): 
  
  Response (S16 or S32)
  
  S111 and S112 are the experiment beggining and end, respectively.

While all trials are around 30s long, to make it consistent, we could use 28s as a standard duration for analysis (because the shortest trial is ~28.5s).
